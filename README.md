collision detection for vehicles with uncertainty in the position represented as a gaussian distribution
The implementation is based on an approximate but quick and accurate method.

import collide

### Functions:

* collide.collide(x1, y1, x2, y2, L1, W1, theta1, L2, W2, theta2)

* collide.plot(x1, y1, x2, y2, L1, W1, theta1, L2, W2, theta2)

### variables:

* x,y: position

* L,W: length and width

* theta: angle of the vehicle in radian
